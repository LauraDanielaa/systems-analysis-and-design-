## Workshop 2 – System Design Document
This workshop is part of the Systems Analysis and Design course at Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas. Building upon the analytical insights from Workshop 1, Workshop 2 focuses on the design phase of a complex system derived from a real Kaggle competition: LLM 20 Questions.

The objective of this workshop is to translate system analysis into a robust, modular, and adaptable system architecture. It includes the identification of key components, data flow, and control mechanisms while integrating principles of sensitivity analysis and chaos theory to address uncertainty and unpredictability in system behavior.

### Key Deliverables
- A high-level system design addressing performance, stability, and feedback loops.

- A technical stack recommendation and implementation outline.

- Strategies for mitigating chaotic factors and sensitive variables.

- A structured and referenced System Design Document in PDF format.
